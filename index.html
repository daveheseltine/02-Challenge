                    Hi there!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So you found this page, huh?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Either you are grading it or found it by astronomical odds!
                    Either way pull up a chair by the warm winter fire and let me spin yer a tale of how I became a web developer.
                    You see, I started off as an engineer - but for my dream job of creating engineering software I first need to learn how to code!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We engineers can't bust piston heads like we used to, but we have our ways.
                    One trick is to tell them stories that don't go anywhere, like the time I caught the ferry over to Sunderland?
                    I needed a new heel for my shoe so I decided to go to Macamland, which is what they called Sunderland in those days.
                    So I tied an onion to my belt - which was the style at the time - now, to take the ferry cost a pound and in those days pound coins had pictures of bumblebees on them.
                    "Give me five bees for a Fiver" you'd say. Now where were we... Oh, yeah.
                    The important thing was that I had an onion on my belt, which was the style at the time.
                    They didn't have white onions because of the rail strikes. The only thing you could get was those big yellow ones.
