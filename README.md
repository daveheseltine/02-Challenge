# 02-Challenge (Trilogy Skills Bootcamp: Week 02 - Challenge)

## Important Notes
I do not have enough web applications to showcase at this point, so I have used the placeholder images and names provided in the starter folder.
> They each individually link to the previous deployed challenge to show that I can code it properly.

Locally the project ran fine with linking resources such as:
> link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./assets/css/style.css"

However GitHub Pages was not functioning with said links, and was edited to be linked as:
> link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../02-Challenge/assets/css/style.css"

## Description
This week the task was to build a portfolio page, which I can add to as the course progresses. 

A portfolio of work can showcase skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights a developer's strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. 

With these points in mind, in this challenge I set myself up for future success by applying the core skills I've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.<a href="#references">*[1]*</a>

## Acceptance Criteria
Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport<a href="#references">*[1]*</a>
